The goal of this project is to analyze data from the Austin B-Cycles program, make recommendations based on the findings, and provide a predictive model for use in the future.

1. Open [bikes_eda.ipynb](https://github.com/db-lab/portfolio/blob/master/Austin_B-cycles/bikes_eda.ipynb) for exploratory data analysis.
2. Open [bike_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/db-lab/portfolio/blob/master/Austin_B-cycles/bike_regression.ipynb). This notebook will bring in outside data to construct a predictive model.
3. Open [kiosks.md](https://github.com/db-lab/portfolio/blob/master/Austin_B-cycles/kiosks.md) to see the density based route map.
