The goal of this project is to analyze data from the Austin B-Cycles program, make reccomendations based on the findings, and provide a predictive model for use in the future.

1. Open bikes_eda.ipynb. If it doesn't render in-browser, a refresh should correct it. This notebook displays the data exploration.
2. Open bike_regression.ipynb. This notebook will bring in outside data to construct a predictive model.
3. Open kiosks.md to see the route map.
